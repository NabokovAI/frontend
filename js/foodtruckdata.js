		"description": "The Market Milkshake Bar is shaking things up in Miami, FL, a food truck that's dedicated to one thing and one thing alone: the milkshake. Not that there's anything wrong with that. In fact, we'd argue it's all that's right in the world, and they've elevated the standard milkshake to a whole new level, featuring premium sweet toppings you won't find anywhere else. \nNo really, we've looked. The Market Milkshake Bar's menu is deceptively simple, featuring classics like shaken strawberry and shaken chocolate on board. But what they're not telling you is that these thick and creamy shakes are topped with premium desserts and candies, upping the sweetness factor by five. At least. Take, for example, the shaken strawberry: it's finished in whipped cream, with a sweet candy rim, with strawberry rock candy sticks and a strawberry shortcake ice cream bar on top. Or the shaken nutella, with a mini jar of nutella and chocolatey pirouette cookies. See what we mean? These sweets must be tasted to be believed, so why wait? Find The Market Milkshake Bar in Miami, or have 'em out to cater your next event. Trust us. It doesn't get much sweeter than this.",
